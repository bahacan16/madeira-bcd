"""MFC from the VC++ redistributable (mfc140.dll, mfc140u.dll); no Wine runs.

Horizon Zero Dawn imports mfc140.dll and stopped at once with c0000135 (build
466, log 12:51:47). The workflow now takes MFC's two DLLs from the same
VC_redist.x64.exe it takes the C++ runtime from; WineProcessBridge.m links
every DLL of that folder into system32, and env.MADEIRA_MFC = 0 leaves MFC out.
Checks:
  - the workflow wants the twelve runtime DLLs plus mfc140.dll and mfc140u.dll,
    counts against the length of that list, and the report expects 14;
  - the payload names the search uses pick each MFC DLL and nothing else
    (not mfc140u for mfc140, not the language or managed MFC DLLs);
  - WineProcessBridge.m: MFC is linked like the rest unless MADEIRA_MFC=0,
    which also removes a link left from an earlier session; read from the
    environment the game's file was exported into before the links are made;
  - tools/fetch-vcruntime.md lists both; the catalog lists env.MADEIRA_MFC,
    on by default.
